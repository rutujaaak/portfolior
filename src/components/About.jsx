                        I am a Final Year CSE Engineering Student pursuing my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering.

                        I come from a family that values both entrepreneurship and education; my father is a businessman, and my mother is a teacher.
                        Growing up in this environment, I have developed a strong work ethic, a commitment to learning, and a collaborative approach.
                        Alongside my two siblings, Iâ€™ve learned the importance of responsibility and teamwork, which I apply to my career endeavors.

                        In my free time, I enjoy expressing my creativity through painting and sketching, and expanding my perspective through reading.
                        These interests keep me balanced and inspired, helping me bring fresh ideas and focus to my work.
